## \*Crickets\*
Right now it's feeling pretty empty, but as we gather and collect
more experiments and recipes we'll be sure to post what we've learned.

## Get Started
If you want to help in our quest to create great tasting low or non-alcohol
beer, please come over to our [GitHub](https://github.com/theznerd/lablab)
and open an issue! (don't worry... the name "issue" is just nomenclature used
by GitHub - it's just a discussion) Let's have a discussion and get some
content generated for The Lab!

### I'm By No Means a Master
At least not yet. I'm beginning my journey into brewing low/non-alcohol beer because I like a challenge.
Frankly, most everything I've tasted thus far (including the "premium" brands) just isn't that great. I
am building out this site as a collection of processes, recipes, and tools that I and the community have
used to brew _good_ low alcohol beer. Beer that doesn't taste like water and hops. Beer that doesn't 
have a thin mouthfeel when you were expecting thickness.

### The Problem is Scale
There exists plenty of equipment on the market to dealcholize beer and to quickly determine the exact ABV 
of your finished beer. The problem? It's all extremely expensive, or even if you could get your hands on
some of the parts (a dealcoholization membrane, for example) requires more finished product than we could
store in our kegerators. Dealcoholization just doesn't scale down well.

### The Other Problem is Knowledge
Let's be honest. Most homebrewers aren't chomping at the bit to make a sub-1% ABV beer. While there are
many encyclopedias full of information on the web (good and not so good) on brewing regular beer, there
aren't too many guides on brewing low ABV beers. And what exists (other than a few select contents) is
just not as deep as we need it to be. So let's join together, strike up a conversation, test some shit, 
and see where our collective knowledge takes us.

### Join Up!
I can only brew and consume so much beer. This blog is open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/theznerd/lablab)
and anyone can contribute. If you don't have the slightest clue where to start, you can always just
post an issue on the Repo. If that is still too daunting - drop us a message in the [Contact](/contact/)
page and we'll make sure that you can share your knowledge with the world.
